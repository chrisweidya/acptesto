TURTLE

Turtles have a hard shell that protects them like a shield, this upper shell is called a carapace.

Turtles also have a lower shell called a plastron.

Some turtles lay eggs in the sand and leave them to hatch on their own. The young turtles make their way to the top of the sand and scramble to the water while trying to avoid predators.

Sea turtles often drown when caught in fishing gear, both nets and longlines. Coastal development can destroy important nesting sites, impact coral reefs, and artificial light from houses and other buildings attracts hatchlings away from the ocean. Pollution like plastic bags are often mistaken for food such as jellyfish and ingested, which blocks their intestines and potentially kills them.  In some countries, they are hunted for their meat and shells and their eggs are eaten.

In some species of turtle the temperature determines if the egg will develop into a male or female, lower temperatures lead to a male while higher temperatures lead to a female.
