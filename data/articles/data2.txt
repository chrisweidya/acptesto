WHALE

The heart of a blue whale is about the size of a VW Beetle car and weighs up to 1000 pounds, that is about as much as 1,111 cans of baked beans!The aorta, a major blood vessel for the heart, is big enough for a human child to crawl through.

Blue whales are pregnant for 10-12 months. The newborn calf is about 7.5 m long and weighs about 5.5 to 7.3 tonnes, nearly as much as 100 men.

The southern right whale has the largest testes in the animal kingdom, each pair weighing around a tonne. That is the same as 1,000 bags of sugar.

An individual fin whale pees about 970 litres per day.

The diet of whales depends on their species; it can range from microscopic plankton to large marine mammals.

Many whales, especially baleen whales, tend to migrate long distances from their cold water feeding grounds to warm-water breeding grounds each year. They travel alone or in groups, or pods, on their annual migrations. Toothed whales often hunt in groups, migrate together and share young-rearing duties.
